    <h1>Dr. Brian Cohn Ph.D.</h1>

<p>You want to invent a proof of concept for a healthcare project. I can help.

<p>I'm a biologist with a penchant for product development—leveraging AI, statistical modeling, and hardware prototyping to solve issues in healthcare, and I've been designing scientific projects for over five years across both biotech industry and academic labs.</p>

<blockquote>For biotech executives and entrepreneurs, I can make the transition; from an idea to a scientifically sound whitepaper, or from a POC to an MVP.</blockquote>

<p>My recent projects include a tendon-driven robot that teaches itself to walk, a signal processing algorithm that characterizes corticospinal neurophysiology from a muscle, a ML project that predicts future opioid abuse using insurance claim data, an auto-encoder that powers a tool for speech language pathologists, and a game AI that continually redesigns itself—so it's always as hard as it needs to be. These projects span across hospitals and biotechnology companies. I want to make an impact for people.

<p>
Alongside my scientific work, I wear other hats:
<ul>Principal, Adventure Biofeedback</ul>
<ul>Scientific Advisor, ArkVC</ul>
<ul>Innovation Studio Mentor, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles</ul>
</p>
<p>Are you working on an interesting, challenging, and important project? Send me a note! I provide consulting, build contract projects, and serve as an expert witness.  Let's find out what's possible with AI and biotech.</p>
