    <h1>Dr. Brian Cohn Ph.D.</h1>

<p>You want to invent a proof of concept for a healthcare project. I can help.

<p>I'm a biologist with a penchant for product development—leveraging AI, statistical modeling, and hardware prototyping to solve issues in healthcare and biotechnology.</p>

<blockquote>For biotech executives and entrepreneurs, I can make the transition; from an idea to a scientifically sound whitepaper, or from a POC to an MVP.</blockquote>

<p>My recent projects include a tendon-driven robot that teaches itself to walk, a signal processing algorithm that characterizes corticospinal neurophysiology from a muscle, a ML project that predicts future opioid abuse using insurance claim data, an auto-encoder that powers a tool for speech language pathologists, and a game AI that continually redesigns itself—so it's always as hard as it needs to be. These projects span across hospitals and biotechnology companies. I want to make an impact for people.

<h3>Are we a fit?</h3>

We might be a good fit if:
    You aren’t technical and need a partner who can work the divide between customers, business, and technical stakeholders
    You have at least $40k to build your app

<p>If you're working on an interesting, challenging, and important project grab a time to chat.</p>
