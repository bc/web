Expose yourself to new content and creating serendipity of ideas.
Try to find anti-fragile ideas, where the best innovations help, but the low points don't affect the mission that much.
If you have an idea and you don't have the resources to test it, it'll churn and you turn it into a petâ€”you get attached to it. Some ideas that stick may just sit for a while until they are appropriate/possible.
